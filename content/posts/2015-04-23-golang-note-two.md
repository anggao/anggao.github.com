### Flow control statements

- Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.
- For is Go's "while"
- Like `for`, the `if` statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.
- A case body breaks automatically, unless it ends with a fallthrough statement.
- A `defer` statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.
- The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.
- Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

### Pointers

- Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a variable.
- The type `*T` is a pointer to a `T` value. Its zero value is `nil`.

```go
var p *int
```

- The `&` operator generates a pointer to its operand.
- The `*` operator denotes the pointer's underlying value.
- Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.

### Struct

- A `struct` is a collection of fields.
- A `struct literal` denotes a newly allocated struct value by listing the values of its fields.

### Arrays

- The type `[n]T` is an array of `n` values of type `T`.

```go
var a [10]int
```

- An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized.

### Slices

- A slice points to an array of values and also includes a length.
- `[]T` is a slice with elements of type `T`.
- Slices can be re-sliced, creating a new slice value that points to the same array.

```go
// is empty
s[lo:lo]
// one element
s[lo:lo+1]
```

- Slices are created with the `make` function. It works by allocating a zeroed array and returning a slice that refers to that array:

```go
a := make([]int, 5)  // len(a)=5
```

- To specify a capacity, pass a third argument to make:

```go
b := make([]int, 0, 5) // len(b)=0, cap(b)=5
b = b[:cap(b)] // len(b)=5, cap(b)=5
b = b[1:]      // len(b)=4, cap(b)=4
```

- The zero value of a slice is `nil`.
- A `nil` slice has a length and capacity of `0`.
- The resulting value of `append` is a slice containing all the elements of the original slice plus the provided values.
- If the backing array of s is too small to fit all the given values a bigger array will be allocated.

### Range

- The range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.

### Maps

- Maps must be created with `make` (not new) before use; the `nil` map is empty and cannot be assigned to.
- Delete an element: `delete(m, key)`
- Test that a key is present with a two-value assignment: `elem, ok = m[key]` If `key` is in `m`, `ok` is `true`. If not, `ok` is `false` and `elem` is the zero value for the map's element type.

### Function closures

- Go functions may be closures. A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body. The function may access and assign to the referenced variables; in this sense the function is "bound" to the variables.
