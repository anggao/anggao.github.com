### Basics

- Every Go program is made up of packages.
- Programs start running in package main.
- factored import statement.

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)
```

- In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.
- Functions in Golang

```go
func add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

- When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.
- A function can return any number of results.
- Go's return values may be named and act just like variables.
- A return statement without arguments returns the current values of the results. This is known as a "naked" return.
- Naked return statements should be used only in short function, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.

```go
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum * 4 / 9
    y = sum - x
    return
}
```

- The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.
- A var statement can be at package or function level.
- If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.
- Short variable declarations: inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.
- Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the `:=` construct is not available.
- Variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks, as with import statements.
- Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.
- Type conversions: The expression `T(v)` converts the value v to the type T.
- Type inference: When declaring a variable without specifying its type (using var without a type or the `:=` syntax), the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand side.
- Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.
- Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.
- An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context.
