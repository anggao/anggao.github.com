### HTTP

- Sending a request

```javascript
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET", "example/data.txt", false);
req.send(null);
consle.log(req.responseText);
// → This is the content of data.txt
console.log(req.status, req.statusText);
// → 200 OK
console.log(req.getResponseHeader("content-type"));
// → text/plain
```

- If we pass true as the third argument to open, the request is asynchronous.

```javascript
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET", "example/data.txt", true);
req.addEventListener("load", function() {
  console.log("Done:", req.status);
});
req.send(null);
```

- HTTP sandboxing

  - Browsers protect us by disallowing scripts to make HTTP requests to other domains
  - Servers can include a header in their response to explicitly indicate to browsers that it is okay for the request to come from other domains: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

- Promises
  - Promises wrap an asynchronous action in an object, which can be passed around and told to do certain things when the action finishes or fails.

```javascript
function get(url) {
  return new Promise(function(succeed, fail) {
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open("GET", url, true);
    req.addEventListener("load", function() {
      if (req.status < 400) succeed(req.responseText);
      else fail(new Error("Request failed: " + req.statusText));
    });
    req.addEventListener("error", function() {
      fail(new Error("Network error"));
    });
    req.send(null);
  });
}
```

- The promise acts as a handle to the request’s outcome.

```javascript
get("example/data.text").then(
  function(text) {
    console.log("data.text: " + text);
  },
  function(error) {
    console.log("Failed to fetch data.text: " + error);
  }
);
```

- Calling `then` produces a new promise, whose result (the value passed to success handlers) depends on the return value of the first function we passed to then.

### Forms and Form Fields

- We can control focus from JavaScript with the `focus` and `blur` methods.
- The value in `document.activeElement` corresponds to the currently focused element.
- HTML also provides the `autofocus` attribute, which produces the same effect but lets the browser know what we are trying to achieve.
- Browsers traditionally also allow the user to move the focus through the document by pressing the Tab key.
- We can influence the order in which elements receive focus with the `tabindex` attribute.
- By default, most types of HTML elements cannot be focused. But you can add a `tabindex` attribute to any element, which will make it focusable.

### Storing data client-side

- You can store string data in a way that survives page reloads by putting it in the `localStorage` object.

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("username", "marijn");
console.log(localStorage.getItem("username"));
// → marijn
localStorage.removeItem("username");
```

- The `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` objects can be used to save information in a way that survives page reloads.
- `localStorage` saves the data forever (or until the user decides to clear it)
- `sessionStorage` saves it until the browser is closed.
