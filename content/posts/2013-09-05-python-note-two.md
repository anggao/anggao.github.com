- Polymorphism: even if you don't know what kind of object a variable refer
  to, you may still able to perform operations on it, that will work differently
  depending on the class(type) of the object

- Polymorphism enables you to call the methods of an object without knowing
  its class (type of object). Encapsulation enables you to use the object
  without worrying about how it's constructd.

- To make a method or attribute private (inaccessible from outside)
  simply starts its name with two underscores

- Inside a class definition, all names beginning with a double underscores
  are `translated` by adding a single underscore and the class name to the beginning.

- Names with an initial underscore are't imported with starred imports.

- `issubclass(SpamFilter, Filter)`

- `isinstance(obj, cls)`

```python
>>>SpamFilter.__bases__
(< class __main__.Filter at 0x171e40> ,)
```

- `obj.__class__` : find out which class an object belongs to

- In multiple inheritance, the methods in the earlier classes override the methods
  in the later ones.

- Object attributes

  - `getattr(object, name [, default])`
  - `hasattr(object, name)`
  - `setattr(object, name, value)`

- Explore built-in exceptions (in module exceptions)

```python
>>>import exceptions
>>>dir(exceptions)
```

- Cataching two exceptions with one block

```python
try:
    doFun()
except (E1, E2):
    backup()
```

- Catching the exception object:

```python
except (ZeroDivisionError, TypeError), e:
# PY3
except (ZeroDivisionError, Typeerror) as e:
```

- example

```python
while True:
    try:
        x = input('Enter x')
        y = input('Enter y')
        value = x / y
        print 'x / y is ', value
    except Exception, e:
        print 'Invalid input ', e
    else:
        break
    finally:
        print 'Done'
```

- If you override the constructor of a class, you need to call the constructor
  of the superclass or risk having an object that isn't properly initialized.

- If you retrieve the method from the class directly, there is no instance to
  which to bind, such method is called unbound, you can supply any self you want.

```python
def __init__(self):
    Bird.__init__(self)
```

- New style classes, `super` is called with the current class and instance as
  its arguments. Any method called on the returned object, will be fetched from the
  superclass. This method returns super object.
  `super(SongBird, self).__init__()`

- In PY3, `super` can be called without any argument.

- sequence and mapping protocol

  - immutable
    - `__len__(sel))` if return `0` treat as `False` in boolean contxt, can overrite with `__nonzero__`
    - `__getitem__(self, key)`
  - mutable
    - `__setitem__(self, key, value)`
    - `__delitem__(self, key)` this is called when someone uses the `del` statement on a part of the object

- For a sequence `x[-n]` is the same as `x[len(x) - n]`
  if the key is of an inappropriate type: `TypeError`
  if the index of a sequence outside the allowed range: `IndexError`

- Examples

```python
def checkIndex(key):
    if not instance(key, (long, int)): raise TypeError
    if key < 0: raise IndexError

class ArithmeticSequence:
    def __init__()elf, start = 0, step = 1):
        self.start = start
        self.step = step
        self.changed = {}

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        checkIndex(key)
        try:
            return changed[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.start + self.step * key
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        checkIndex(key)
        changed[key] = value
```

```python
class CounterList(list):
    def __init__(self, *args):
        super(CounterList, self).__init__(*args)
        self.counter = 0
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        self.counter += 1
        return super(CounterList, self).__getitem__(key)
```

- The attributes that are defined through their accessors
  are often called properties

- Property example

```python
class Rectangle(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.width = 0
        self.height = 0
    def setSize(self, size):
        self.width, self.height = size
    def getSize(self):
        return self.width, self.height
    size = property(getSize, setSize)
```

- `property(fget, fset, fdel, doc)` returns a property, all arguments are optional

- `property` isn't really a function, it's a class whose instances have some methods
  that do all the work. Those methods defines that so-called `descriptor`
  protocol. Eg: if the attribute bound to an object that implements `__get__` method,
  the object won't simply retuned, instead `__get__` method will be called and the resulting
  value will be returned

- **static methods VS class methods**

  - static methods are defined without self arguments and they can be called
    directly on the class itself
  - class methods are defined with a self-like parameter normally called `cls`.
    You can call class methods directly on the class object too, but parameter then automatically is
    bound to the class.

- `__getattr__` `__setattr__` and friends

  - `__getattribute__(self, name)` : Automatically called when the attribute name is called (only on new-style class)

  - `__getattr__(self, name)`: Automatically called when the attribute name is called and the object has no such attribute

  - `__setattr__(self, name, value)`: Automatically called when an attempt is made to bind the attribute name to value

  - `__delattr__(self, name)`

- Example

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self):
        self.width = 0
        self.height = 0

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if name == 'size':
            self.width, self.height = value
        else:
            self.__dict__[name] = value

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        if name == 'size':
            return self.width, self.height
        else:
            raise AttributeError
```

- `__dict__` contains a dic with all the instance attributes

- There is a trap associated with `__getattribute__`, it intercepts all attributre
  access, and `__dict__` as well. The only safe way to access attribute on self inside
  `__getattribute__` is to use the `__getattribute__` method of the superclass
