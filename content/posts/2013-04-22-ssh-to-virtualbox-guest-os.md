1. `sudo apt-get install ssh`

2) make sure ssh service is working
   `netstat -tlp`

   you should see following line:

```shell
tcp        0      0 *:ssh                   *:*                     LISTEN
```

3. change virtualbox network setting to: Bridged Adapter with vnic0

4. `ifconfig`
   make sure host OS vnic0 address is in the same net with guest OS p2p1
