# Gatsby - Blazing fast React.js static site generator


Transform plain text and data into dynamic blogs and websites using the latest web technologies.

Supports pages written in Markdown, HTML, and React.js out of the box. Easy to add support for additional file types.

Leverages React's component model and React Router's "nested component hierarchy" to make templating incredibly powerful and intuitive.

All templates, css, and content are hot reloadable â€” powered by webpack. Makes for a brilliant development experience
